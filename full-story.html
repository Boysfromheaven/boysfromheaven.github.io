To be made

The band has come a long way since we formed in the autumn of 2014. Now a seven-piece group, we spend our time together in the practice room playing around with old material and, more importantly, writing new songs and bouncing ideas off each other, as well as on stage rocking our freakin’ hearts out.

We spent most of the first year of our existence in the practice room perfecting the original songs deemed to be worthy of being labeled "Boys From Heaven tracks”, as well as recording, both in our home studio and in a professional studio. We played a single gig at Erntefest All-Over, a German hard rock festival, and received favourable and flattering reviews, among others by Mein-Scheessel.de who had the following to say about us:

“Copenhagen-based Boys From Heaven […] surprised the audience with smooth classic rock, that sounded as though it were Roger Waters of Pink Floyd who had written the music. With songs featuring four part vocal harmonies, tambourines and [saxophone hooks], the audience was gobsmacked. It was hard to believe that this was the band’s first concert." 

In late 2016 we switched to the current seven member line-up, and the band is going stronger than ever. We’ve been playing gigs around Denmark since then, and the energy both onstage and off has been off the charts.

October 7 2017 was the day that we released our EP "No Way! But Anyway" as well as hosting a release concert at Lygten Station, that ended up being sold out. The EP has received critical acclaim, with one reviewer from the Danish site Bands of Tomorrow, who gave it 4 out of 5 stars, calling it "probably the strongest and most well executed Danish debut release that I have heard this year"; one critic from Danish GFR saying "it’s been a long while since I have heard such a well executed, well produced and well written debut release from a Danish rock band”; and Swedish Rockfarbror.se giving it 4 out of 5 stars and saying "It's really smooth rock 'n' roll that even Huey Lewis would have liked".

We think that is because we are not your run-of-the-mill, one-guitar-a-bass-and-a-drummer rusty garage rock band. We continue to maintain an ironic twist, and an approach to music which entails not taking ourselves far too seriously. And with elements like saxophones and dominating piano riffs, wide vocal harmonies and powerful leads, we think that our music stands out as something unique and yet reminiscent of a time when music was more ambitious, more varied and, above all, more FUN! That’s right, we’re talking about the great eighties, when synthesisers were unapologetically exaggerated, and playing rock with a pop twist was a positive thing. Who says songs in major keys can’t have heart-felt, face-melting guitar solos? Not us, that's for sure.
