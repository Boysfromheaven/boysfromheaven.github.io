                        album by Danish rock band Boys From Heaven, released through Target Records.
                        <br/>
                        Inspired by AOR legends like Journey and Toto, Boys From Heaven embody the iconic, grandiose
                        sound with a twist. The great eighties captured in the modern studio.
                        <br/>
                        The band's 2017 EP, which was accompanied by a sold out release concert, was described as
                        <i>"probably the strongest and most complete Danish debut release this year"</i> by Bands of Tomorrow.
                        Since then group's online fan base has more than quadrupled, and they have played established
                        Danish venues and festivals such as Posten Odense, the DR Concert House, Parkrock and Kloften
                        Festival.
                        In 2020 the band signed with Danish independent label Target Records (Mike Tramp, Soren Andersen, 
                        Tue West).

                            release that I have heard this year.
                            Boys From Heaven's sound is already in these early stages of their career so well shaped
                            that it
                            is hard to see how the record companies haven't already noticed them [...]" </i>
